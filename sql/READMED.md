This project is a Course Registration Database created using SQL. The database allows students to register for courses and keeps track of students, courses, instructors, departments, and enrollments. The database includes the following tables: Departments table stores information about academic departments. Instructors table stores information about instructors and links each instructor to a department. Courses table stores course information such as course name, credits, instructor, and department. Students table stores information about students who can register for courses. Enrollments table connects students and courses and tracks enrollment status such as Enrolled, Completed, or Withdrawn. Course_Requirements table is used to define prerequisite relationships between courses. The SQL queries in this project allow adding new students, enrolling students in courses, updating enrollment status, viewing students enrolled in a specific course, finding courses taught by a specific instructor, listing courses by department, listing students who completed a course, and handling late course registration.

Project structure: CourseRegistrationDB.sql README.md

To run the project, open SQL Server Management Studio, create the database CourseRegistrationDB, then run the SQL queries in the following order: create tables, insert data, and then select queries to show different situations or run your own query.
